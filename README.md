# HowZachPlaysOthello

This bot is really exciting! It plays as poorly as Zach does IRL.

Dan wrote the minimax and the functions to do with the heuristic.

Sophie wrote the random player, the move update functions, and the README.

We worked together to come up with the heuristic itself, the outline of the functions,
and to do the debugging.

We didn't make any changes to our AI. We did, however, change our player name to 
"heartizach," a brilliant pun we found online.

"This strategy will work because Zach always beats me at Othello. Since we've emulated
the power of Zach." - Dan
